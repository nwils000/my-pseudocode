# Performing a Backflip

- Find a safe area (flat and padded like grass, mattress, or trampoline).
- Inspect the area for obstacles or hazards.

- Positioning:
  - Go to the middle of the area, stand straight, look forward.

- Pre-jump:
  - Bend knees to 45 degrees.
  - Swing arms back, reaching 30 degrees past vertical.
  - IF set, THEN:
    - Swing arms overhead with full power.
    - Straighten knees with full power.
    - Flex calves fully.

- IF not airborne, strength training may be needed.

- WHILE airborne:
  - IF <80% rotated:
    - Tuck knees to chest with full power.
    - Throw head and torso back fully.
  - ELSE, for landing preparation:
    - Knees slightly bent (15 degrees from full extension).
    - Realign chest and head over knees.

- Landing:
  - Upon ground contact, extend knees to absorb impact.
  - Use arms for balance upon landing to prevent falls.
